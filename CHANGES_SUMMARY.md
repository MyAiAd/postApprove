# PostApprove Changes Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED CHANGES

I have successfully completed the following renames from "adApprove" to "postApprove":

### 1. Package Configuration
- **package.json**: Changed name from "adapprove" to "postapprove"

### 2. Application Metadata  
- **app/layout.tsx**: Updated title and description to "PostApprove - Social Media Post Approval System"

### 3. Documentation
- **README.md**: 
  - Changed title to "PostApprove - Social Media Post Approval System"
  - Updated description to focus on social media posts instead of images
  - Updated usage instructions to reference "posts" instead of "images"
  - Updated storage setup to use "posts" bucket instead of "images"

### 4. Email Configuration
- **app/api/send-notification/route.ts**: Changed email sender from "AdApprove" to "PostApprove"

### 5. Migration Plan
- **migrationSteps.txt**: Created comprehensive deployment guide with all necessary steps

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHANGES STILL NEEDED

The application currently references "images" throughout the codebase, but for a social media post approval system, these should be "posts". This requires significant refactoring:

### Database Schema Changes Required:
- `images` table ‚Üí `posts` table
- All foreign key references need updating
- Storage bucket from "images" to "posts"

### Code Files Requiring Updates:
1. **supabase-schema.sql** - Change table name and references
2. **app/api/send-notification/route.ts** - Update database queries 
3. **app/approve/[campaignId]/page.tsx** - Major refactor needed
4. **app/page.tsx** - Update all image references to posts
5. **lib/supabase.ts** - Rename Image interface to Post
6. **app/globals.css** - Update CSS class names

### Recommended Approach:
You have two options:

**Option A: Quick Launch (Minimal Changes)**
- Keep existing "images" references for now
- Focus on getting the app deployed and functional
- Refactor to "posts" terminology later

**Option B: Complete Refactor (Recommended)**
- I can help you refactor all "image" references to "post" now
- This ensures the app is properly aligned with its new purpose
- Takes more time but results in cleaner, more maintainable code

## üìã DEPLOYMENT READINESS

The app is ready for deployment with current changes. The migration steps document provides a complete guide for:
- GitHub repository setup
- Supabase configuration  
- Vercel deployment
- Environment variables
- Testing procedures

Would you like me to proceed with the complete refactor (Option B) or would you prefer to deploy as-is and refactor later?
